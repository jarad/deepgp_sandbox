Next week: Nate Garton will lead a discussion on the Damianou and Lawrence paper (<http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v31/damianou13a.pdf>). 


Notes from discussion:

Binary black hole chirp mass has a step-function structure. Deep GPs were presented at Newton Institute and the application was on a step-function. 

Two approaches to Deep GPs: 1) Dunlop et al and 2) Neil Lawrence, see

Need data to estimate these models, 
but computation difficulties arise due to matrix inversions and determines when 
you have a lot of data. 
Two approaches to estimation: 1) variational Bayes or 2) optimization. 

Deep GP models may be unidentified, 
but this may not matter because the correlation structure (at the top level?) is 
what is important. 
Perhaps the models can be identified using an informative prior.
