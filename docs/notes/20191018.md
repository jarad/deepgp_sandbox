Introduction by Jacob on variational inference (VI)

- Minimizing KL-divergence between *variational* distribution and the true distribution
- Using ELBO which is a lower bound on the marginal likelihood
- Shiny app for [VI for univariate Gaussian Mixture Model](https://github.com/jwmortensen/variational_inference)


Problems with variational inference

- Unknown accuracy of approximation
  - student of Michael Jordan, name?, may have ameliorated this
- How well does variational inference capture first-order properties, e.g. posterior means?
  - Seems to capture means well
- Cannot accurately capture variances, sometimes correlations
- Computations may be difficult
  - optimization to local modes
  - may require Monte Carlo steps
